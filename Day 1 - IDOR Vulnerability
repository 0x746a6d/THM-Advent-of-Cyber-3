Day 1 -- IDOR Vulnerabilities


IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference and is a type of access control vulnerability. An access control vulnerability is when an 
attacker can gain access to information or actions not intended for them. An IDOR vulnerability can occur when a web server receives
user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), and too much trust has been placed on that input data, and the web 
application does not validate whether the user should, in fact, have access to the requested object.

Seeing a product, user, or service identifier in the URL or otherwise is a must to test. IDOR vulnerabilities can reveal sensitive information,
as well as potentially giving you access to usually restricted site functionality.
